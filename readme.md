Coastal Erosion Simulator

## Key

Yellow Pixels - sand particles.

White Pixels - water/wave particles.

Red Pixels - indicate water particles that have removed a sand particle.

## Rules

- Each water particle can only remove one sand particle.
- Only sand particles directly touching the water may be removed.
- Plants only increase the durability of the sand particles adjacent to it.
- Walls can be destroyed eventually.

## Note

- Erosion is not this quick in real life.
- There are many different factors to coastal erosion in real life, not included in this simulation.
